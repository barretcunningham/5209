# Reefing Procedure

Guidelines for reefing main and headsails in heavy weather.

## Before Reefing

- Review apparent wind, sea state, and sail plan
- Crew positions and safety gear
- Prepare lines (main sheet, traveler, halyards, reef pennants)

## Executing Reef

- Ease sheet/traveler to depower
- Lower halyard to pre-mark, tension reef tack and clew
- Re-tension halyard, trim sheets, tidy lines

## Post-Reef Checks

- Sail shape and chafe points
- Winch handles stowed and lines secured
- Update log with sail configuration

Document reefing hardware routing, tack hook details, and preferred halyard marks.
