# Departure Procedure

Comprehensive pre-departure checklist and procedures.

## Prior to Departure

### Dinghy and Lines
- For catamarans: tie the dinghy in davits and secure with brace lines to prevent sideways movement
- For monohulls: tie tender alongside so tow rope cannot foul the propeller
- Ensure no lines are hanging in the water
- Retrieve all fishing lines

### Deck and Safety
- Stow all loose items both inside and outside the boat
- Secure fenders and dock lines in storage lockers
- Ensure all hatches and ports are firmly shut
- Fit all lifelines before departing

### Systems Check
- Run engines for 20 minutes at approximately 1200-1500 RPM to charge batteries
- Check all engine systems, especially:
  - Battery charging
  - Exhaust cooling water
  - Engine fluids and raw water
  - Fuel valves

### Navigation Planning
- Plan route considering hazards, weather, and tides
- Complete passage planner
- Reef mainsail if necessary based on wind conditions
- Check navigation electronics and communications
- Review charts and cruising guides for intended route

### Shore Power Transition
- Disconnect shore power if at marina
- Switch from shore power to generator/battery system
- Verify battery charger operation

## Departure Communications

- Notify base of intended anchorage and route before departure
- Confirm at morning radio schedule (8:00am) or call if departing earlier
- Provide backup communication plan

## Casting Off

### When Departing a Mooring
- Monitor mooring location before and after dropping
- Ensure mooring line is kept well clear of propellers
- May need to reverse away to avoid rope fouling

### Initial Maneuvering
- Begin departure only after all systems are checked and ready
- Follow planned line order and communications protocol
- Proceed at 3 knots or less until well clear of shore or reef

### Post-Departure
- Stow fenders and dock lines properly
- Make log entry with departure time and conditions
- Begin monitoring position and weather

## When Underway

### Holding Tanks
- When more than one nautical mile offshore, empty and flush holding tanks
- Ensure discharge valves are reopened after flushing

### Navigation
- Always pay attention to location
- Keep well clear of hazards, shoreline, and reef
- Slow down or change course to suit sea conditions
- Never rely on only one source of navigation information

### Communications
- Monitor VHF channels as appropriate

## Approaching Any Anchorage or Shore

### Speed and Sail Reduction
- Slow down and take down all sails
- Reduce speed to less than 3 knots

### Lookout and Navigation
- Place reliable lookout on bow
- Use multiple navigation aids:
  - Charts
  - Cruising guide diagrams and aerial photos
  - GPS plotter
  - Visual observation
  - Depth sounder (with caution)

### Safety Note
Our boat is fitted with AIS. Speed, time, and location are recorded and available to insurance companies and authorities for incident investigation.

!!! warning "Critical Speed Rule"
    Exceeding 3 knots within 70m of shore, another boat, any reef, any navigation aid, or when approaching any anchorage will void insurance cover.

## Anchoring Procedure

### Site Selection
- Select location considering wind, depth, reef, and surrounding vessels
- Ensure adequate swing room for tidal and wind changes
- Verify water depth is between 2m (at low tide) and 15m (at high tide)

### Dropping Anchor
- Bring boat to complete stop
- Drop anchor and lay out chain:
  - Minimum 40m of chain for depths up to 10m
  - 4Ã— the depth for depths over 10m (at high tide)
  - All chain in winds over 25 knots or depths of 15m

### Setting the Anchor
- Once chain is stretched out, run engines in reverse at low revs for 5-10 minutes
- This digs in the anchor and confirms it has taken hold
- After confirming anchor is set, fit rope bridle or snubbing line
- Let out additional chain so weight transfers to bridle

!!! tip "Confirming Anchor Hold"
    The only way to confirm the anchor has taken is to operate the boat slowly in reverse for 5-10 minutes.

## Mooring Pickup

### Approach
- Select mooring considering suitability for boat size and conditions
- Approach slowly into wind or current
- Face same direction as other moored boats
- Come to complete stop 3-5m from mooring

### Pickup
- Motor slowly forward to pickup rope
- Use boat hook to retrieve floating rope
- Secure to vessel in appropriate manner per operations manual
- Verify secure attachment before shutting down engines

!!! danger "Mooring Caution"
    Moorings and mooring ropes caught on propellers are a major cause of structural damage. Always use extreme caution and ensure mooring buoy and rope stay clear of propellers.
