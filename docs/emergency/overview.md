# Emergency Procedures

Comprehensive emergency procedures for critical situations. In any emergency, the safety of the crew is the highest priority.

!!! danger "Emergency Priority"
    The safety of all persons on board takes precedence over saving the boat or any equipment.

## Emergency Communications

### VHF Radio Distress Calls

Your boat's VHF Radio is your primary method of emergency communication. The emergency channel is **Channel 16**.

#### MAYDAY Call (Life-Threatening Emergency)

Use MAYDAY when there is grave and imminent danger requiring immediate assistance:
- Severe injury or medical emergency
- Fire that cannot be controlled
- Sinking or flooding

   - "MAYDAY [boat name]"
   - "My position is [latitude/longitude or description]"
   - "We have [nature of emergency]"
   - "We require immediate assistance"
   - "We have [number] persons on board"
   - "Over"
4. Release transmit button and listen for response
5. Repeat if no response received within 30 seconds

#### PAN PAN Call (Urgent but Not Life-Threatening)

Use PAN PAN for urgent situations requiring assistance but not immediate danger to life:
- Medical assistance needed (non-life-threatening)
- Mechanical breakdown in dangerous location
- Dragging anchor in crowded anchorage
- Loss of steering or propulsion near hazards

**PAN PAN Procedure:**

1. Switch to Channel 16
2. Press and hold transmit button

3. Drop sails if possible
4. Proceed under power for recovery

### After Recovery

- Treat for hypothermia (remove wet clothes, wrap in blankets, warm drinks)
- Monitor for shock
- Seek medical attention
- Log incident with time, position, and circumstances

## Fire

!!! danger "Fire Priority"
    If fire cannot be quickly controlled, prepare to abandon ship. Never risk lives to save the boat.

### General Fire Response

1. **Shout "FIRE"** - Alert all crew
2. **Assess location and severity**
3. **Cut off fuel source** if possible
4. **Close hatches** to starve fire of oxygen if safe to do so
5. **Use appropriate extinguisher** - fight fire from upwind
6. **Prepare to abandon ship** if fire spreads
7. **Make MAYDAY call** if fire cannot be controlled

### Engine Room Fire

1. **Shut down engines immediately**
2. **Close fuel shut-off valves**
3. **Turn off battery switches** if safe to do so
4. **DO NOT open engine compartment** - this provides oxygen to the fire
5. **Discharge fixed fire suppression system** if equipped
6. **Use engine room fire ports** to direct extinguisher without opening main access
7. **Monitor for re-ignition**
8. **Prepare to abandon ship** if fire cannot be controlled

!!! warning "Engine Compartment"
    Opening the engine compartment during a fire provides oxygen and can cause a backdraft. Use fire ports or fixed suppression system.

### Galley Fire

#### Stovetop Fire:
1. **Turn off gas/fuel supply** at source
2. **DO NOT use water on oil/grease fires**
3. **Use fire blanket** to smother flame
4. **Use appropriate extinguisher** if fire spreads

2. **Use CO2 or dry powder extinguisher** (never water)
3. **Do not restore power** until fault is identified and repaired

## Flooding

### Immediate Response

1. **Identify source of water**
2. **Alert all crew**
3. **Start bilge pumps** - all available pumps
4. **Assign crew to manual pumping** if needed
5. **Locate and stop the leak** if possible

### Leak Below Waterline

1. **Stuff leak with cloth, cushions, or bedding**
2. **Use collision mat** over hull exterior if possible
3. **Wedge or shore temporary patch** from inside
4. **Close seacocks** if leak is from through-hull
5. **Continue pumping**
6. **Make PAN PAN call** if leak cannot be controlled
7. **Prepare to abandon ship** if flooding continues

### Through-Hull Failure

1. **Close seacock immediately**
2. **Stuff with soft wooden plug** or emergency plug
3. **Wrap with rubber and hose clamps**
4. **Monitor closely**

### After Flooding is Controlled

- Continue monitoring bilge levels
- Inspect repair regularly
- Head for nearest safe harbor
- Consider professional hull survey

## Grounding

!!! warning "Tidal Considerations"
    The response to grounding depends critically on whether the tide is rising or falling.

### Initial Assessment

1. **Note time and tidal state** - is tide rising or falling?
2. **Check for damage** - inspect hull, through-hulls, keel
3. **Check bilges** for water ingress
4. **Assess sea conditions** - is weather deteriorating?
5. **Check depth around boat** using lead line or dinghy

### Grounding on Rising Tide

With rising tide, you have time to carefully work free:

1. **Reduce weight** - shift crew, water, and gear away from grounded area
2. **Heel boat** - use halyard to dinghy or kedge anchor to reduce draft
3. **Wait for tide** to lift boat
4. **Use engine carefully** once buoyant - reverse away slowly
5. **Do not force engine** against hard grounding

### Grounding on Falling Tide

Falling tide requires immediate action:

1. **Act immediately** - you have limited time before boat is firmly aground
2. **Attempt to power off** - full throttle in reverse (if undamaged)
3. **Heel boat aggressively** - all crew to one side, use halyard to dinghy
4. **Lay kedge anchor** - use dinghy to place anchor in deep water
5. **Winch boat toward kedge** while powering in reverse
6. **If unable to free boat:**
   - Prepare for extended grounding
   - Secure boat to prevent rolling
   - Consider laying anchor to windward to prevent being driven further aground
   - Make PAN PAN call for tow assistance
   - Monitor boat as tide falls

### If Boat Will Be High and Dry

1. **Secure boat with multiple anchors** to prevent rolling
2. **Pad hull** where it contacts bottom
3. **Remove crew if unsafe** to remain aboard
4. **Wait for next high tide**
5. **Monitor weather** - deteriorating conditions require different response

### After Refloating

- Thoroughly inspect hull for damage
- Check all through-hulls and seacocks
- Monitor bilges closely
- Seek professional survey if hard impact occurred

## Collision

### Immediate Actions

1. **Check for injuries** - attend to crew first
2. **Assess damage** - inspect point of impact thoroughly
3. **Check bilges** - is boat taking on water?
4. **Exchange information** with other vessel if involved
5. **Take photographs** of damage
6. **Note time, position, conditions**

### If Taking on Water

1. **Follow flooding procedures** (see Flooding section above)
2. **Make PAN PAN or MAYDAY call** depending on severity
3. **Prepare to abandon ship** if damage is severe

### Collision with Submerged Object

1. **Assess damage immediately**
2. **Check for propeller damage** - unusual vibration indicates damage
3. **Inspect rudder and steering**
4. **Monitor bilges closely**
5. **Reduce speed and head for harbor** if damage is minor

### Reporting Requirements

- Report all collisions to maritime authorities
- Document all details for insurance purposes
- Obtain witness statements if available
- Do not admit fault at the scene

## Loss of Propulsion

### Engine Failure

1. **Attempt restart** following normal procedures
2. **Check fuel supply** - fuel valves open, sufficient fuel
3. **Check cooling water** - overheating can cause shutdown
4. **Check for obvious problems** - loose wires, leaks, alarms
5. **Deploy anchor** if in dangerous location
6. **Raise sails** if conditions permit
7. **Make PAN PAN call** if unable to resolve and in dangerous location

### Propeller Fouling

Common cause: rope or line wrapped around propeller.

1. **Stop engine immediately** - do not attempt to power through
2. **Shift to neutral**
3. **Inspect propeller** - use mask and snorkel if necessary
4. **Cut away fouling** - use knife, careful of hands near prop
5. **Check shaft and seal** after clearing

!!! danger "Propeller Safety"
    Always ensure engine is OFF and in neutral before anyone goes near the propeller.

## Medical Emergencies

### Serious Injury or Illness

1. **Provide first aid** from ship's medical kit
2. **Make PAN PAN or MAYDAY call** depending on severity
3. **Request medical advice** via radio
4. **Arrange evacuation** if necessary - helicopter or fast boat
5. **Prepare helicopter landing area** if applicable:
   - Clear foredeck
   - Remove or secure loose items
   - Brief crew on helicopter safety

### Calling for Medical Evacuation

Provide the following information:
- Nature of injury/illness
- Patient's age and gender
- Vital signs if known
- Treatment provided so far

- Weather and sea conditions

## Gas Leak

### LPG (Cooking Gas) Leak

1. **Turn off gas at bottle immediately**
2. **Extinguish all flames** and smoking materials
3. **Do not operate electrical switches** - can cause spark
4. **Ventilate thoroughly** - open hatches, ports, and companionway
5. **Check bilges** - LPG is heavier than air and sinks
6. **Use bilge blower** if safe to do so
7. **Locate leak** using soapy water (bubbles indicate leak)
8. **Do not use gas system** until leak is repaired
9. **Evacuate boat** if leak cannot be controlled

!!! danger "LPG Hazard"
    LPG is heavier than air and accumulates in bilges where it can be ignited by bilge pump switches. Ventilate thoroughly before operating any electrical equipment.

## Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas produced by engines and generators. It is deadly.

### Symptoms
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Nausea
- Confusion
- Loss of consciousness

### Response

1. **Move victim to fresh air immediately**
2. **Shut down engine/generator**
3. **Ventilate boat thoroughly**
4. **Provide oxygen** if available
5. **Call for medical assistance** - make PAN PAN or MAYDAY call
6. **Monitor victim** - be prepared to perform CPR
7. **Seek immediate medical attention** - CO poisoning requires hospital treatment

### Prevention

- Never run engine or generator with poor ventilation
- Never run generator with stern cabin doors/windows open
- Install and maintain CO detectors
- Keep exhaust systems properly maintained

## De-Masting

### If Mast Falls

1. **Ensure crew safety** - stay clear of rigging
2. **Cut away rigging** if mast is alongside and endangering hull
3. **Recover mast if possible** - secure alongside or bring aboard
4. **If mast cannot be recovered:**
   - Cut free to prevent hull damage
   - Mark position with floating marker
5. **Use engine** for propulsion
6. **Make PAN PAN call** to alert other vessels
7. **Proceed to nearest harbor** under power

### Jury Rigging

If mast remains partially standing or a jury rig is possible:
- Use spinnaker pole or boom as temporary mast
- Rig emergency sail from available canvas
- Proceed cautiously to harbor

## Steering Failure

### Immediate Actions

1. **Attempt to steer with emergency tiller** (if equipped)
2. **Check steering system** - broken cable, hydraulic leak, loose components
3. **Use engine for steering** - vary power between engines on twin-engine vessels
4. **Rig emergency steering** using drogue or buckets astern
5. **Make PAN PAN call** if unable to steer safely
6. **Request tow** if necessary

### Jury Steering Systems

- Attach lines to rudder post and lead to winches
- Use spinnaker pole as steering oar
- Trail drogue or buckets to provide directional control

## Marine Stingers (Jellyfish)

### Dangerous Species

**Box Jellyfish** and **Irukandji** are potentially deadly. Box jellyfish season is typically November to May in tropical waters.

### Prevention

- Wear protective clothing (stinger suits) when swimming in season
- Avoid swimming at dawn/dusk in stinger season
- Stay alert for warning signs

### Treatment for Stings

#### Box Jellyfish:
1. **Call for help immediately** - potential medical emergency
2. **Pour vinegar liberally** over sting area - this inactivates stinging cells
3. **Do not rub area**
4. **Remove tentacles** carefully with stick or gloved hand
5. **Treat for shock**
6. **Seek immediate medical attention** - call for evacuation if severe
7. **Be prepared to perform CPR**

#### Other Jellyfish:
1. **Pour vinegar** over sting area
2. **Remove tentacles** carefully
3. **Apply cold pack** or ice (after vinegar treatment)
4. **Seek medical attention** if symptoms worsen

!!! danger "Vinegar First"
    Always use vinegar first for tropical jellyfish stings. Keep multiple bottles of vinegar in first aid kit during stinger season.

## Abandon Ship

Abandoning ship is a last resort when the boat is sinking, on fire beyond control, or in imminent danger of breaking up.

### When to Abandon

- Uncontrolled fire
- Uncontrolled flooding
- Boat breaking up in severe weather
- Immediate danger of sinking

!!! warning "Last Resort"
    Never abandon ship until it is absolutely necessary. Many sailors have died after abandoning boats that remained afloat. Step UP into the life raft - only abandon when the boat is sinking beneath you.

### Abandon Ship Procedure

1. **Make MAYDAY call** - give position and number of persons on board
2. **Activate EPIRB** - ensure it is transmitting
3. **Put on life jackets** - all crew
4. **Gather:**
   - EPIRB (if not already activated)
   - Handheld VHF radio
   - Flares
   - Water and food
   - First aid kit
   - Warm clothing/blankets
   - Flashlight
5. **Launch life raft** - secure painter before inflating
6. **Board life raft** - strong swimmers last
7. **Cut painter** only when all aboard
8. **Deploy sea anchor** to prevent drifting
9. **Fire flares** if rescue vessel in sight
10. **Stay with life raft** - do not attempt to swim to shore

### In the Life Raft

- Keep dry and warm
- Ration water and food
- Take anti-seasickness medication
- Keep lookout
- Fire flares when aircraft or vessels sighted
- Maintain hope - rescue will come

## After Any Emergency
