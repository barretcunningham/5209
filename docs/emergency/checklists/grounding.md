# Grounding Response Checklist

1. Note time and tidal state immediately (rising or falling tide).
2. Check for hull damage and monitor bilges for water ingress.
3. Assess depth around boat and determine if immediate action required.
4. **If tide is falling:** Act immediately - power off in reverse, heel boat, lay kedge anchor.
5. **If tide is rising:** Work carefully - shift weight, heel boat, wait for tide to lift.
6. Check all through-hulls, seacocks, and rudder after refloating.
7. Make PAN PAN call if unable to free boat before low tide.
8. Secure boat with multiple anchors if extended grounding expected.

See [Emergency Overview](../overview.md#grounding) for detailed grounding procedures.
