## Operating Procedures

### Pre-Start Checks

!!! warning "Critical Checks Before Starting"
    - Verify hull valve is open
    - Check pre-filter cartridges are installed
    - Ensure pressure regulator knob is set to minimum before first start
    - Verify water tanks have capacity for production

### First Use / After Long Storage

1. **Flush the system with fresh water** (1 minute):
   - Watermaker must be OFF
   - Open pressure regulator fully (counterclockwise)
   - Turn 3-way valve on pre-pump to fresh water position
   - Allow pressurized fresh water to flush system
   - Return 3-way valve to seawater position

2. **When to flush**:
   - First time use
   - After changing filters
   - After boat has been grounded
   - After storage >1 month
   - Before starting after >10 days idle

### Manual Mode Startup

1. **Set mode switch to MANUAL**

2. **Press START button**
   - Pre-pump starts
   - Low pressure gauge needle rises to green zone

3. **Gradually increase pressure** (~1 minute process):
   - Slowly turn pressure regulator knob clockwise
   - First bring pressure to middle of orange zone
   - Continue gradually to green zone (60-65 bar)
   - **Do not rush** - take full minute for pressure build-up

4. **Monitor production**:
   - Green LED lights = good quality water
   - Flowmeter shows production rate
   - Yellow LED = poor quality (water diverted overboard)
   - Red LED = alarm condition

!!! warning "High Pressure Alarm"
    If pressure is set too high, red alarm LED will light and watermaker stops. Lower pressure with regulator knob and restart.

### Stopping Without Rinsing

Use this method only if watermaker will be used again within 10 days.

1. **Set mode switch to OFF**

2. **Lower pressure regulator**:
   - Turn knob fully counterclockwise until gauge shows minimum
   - Then reopen by 1/4 turn clockwise

!!! info "Rinsing Requirements"
    - **Within 10 days**: No rinsing required
    - **10+ days idle**: Must rinse before next use
    - **Monthly**: Rinse if not being used regularly
    - **Extended storage (>1 month)**: Must sterilize membranes

### Stopping With Automatic Rinsing

Recommended method when watermaker will not be used for >10 days.

1. **While watermaker is running**:
   - Turn pressure regulator knob counterclockwise
   - Pressure gauge will drop to minimum
   - Then reopen by 1/4 turn clockwise

2. **Automatic rinse sequence**:
   - Watermaker stops producing water
   - Green AND yellow LEDs light up
   - Rinse runs for 30 seconds automatically
   - LEDs turn off, blue LED flashes
   - Set mode switch to OFF

**Benefits of automatic rinsing**:
- Replaces seawater with fresh water in membranes
- Washes pre-filters
- Flushes debris back through hull valve

### Manual Rinsing Procedure

Used for maintenance or if automatic rinse not performed.

**3-Way Valve Positions on Pre-Pump**:

| Position | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Handle down | Normal seawater operation |
| Handle horizontal | Closed (for filter changes) |
| Handle up | Fresh water rinsing/sterilization |

**Manual Rinse Steps**:

1. Watermaker must be OFF
2. Turn 3-way valve handle UP (fresh water position)
3. Let fresh water run through system for 1 minute
4. Return 3-way valve handle DOWN (seawater position)

## Maintenance

### Membrane Care

**Critical Rules**:

!!! danger "Membrane Enemies"
    - **Pressurized fresh water** - worst enemy of membranes
    - **Freezing** (below 0°C) - causes rupture
    - **High heat** (above 60°C) - prevents salt removal
    - **Drying out** - after first use, must stay wet

**Membrane Life**:
- Normal flow reduction of 10-15% over time is expected
- Rinsing can improve output
- Replace membranes when flow is no longer satisfactory

### Rinsing Schedule

| Scenario | Action Required |
|----------|----------------|
| Daily use | No rinsing needed |
| Idle 10 days or less | No rinsing needed |
| Idle more than 10 days | Rinse before next use |
| Not used regularly | Rinse monthly |
| Extended storage (>1 month) | Must sterilize |

### Filter Replacement

**Pre-Filter Cartridges**:
- **25 micron** (first stage)
- **5 micron** (second stage)
- Replace when flow decreases or pressure rises
- Always flush system with fresh water after changing filters

**Replacement Procedure**:
1. Close hull valve
2. Turn 3-way valve to closed position (horizontal)
3. Use filter wrench to unscrew housings
4. Replace cartridges
5. Check O-rings are in place
6. Reassemble and flush system

### Sterilization

Required for storage >1 month, maximum 6 months sterilized storage.

**Method 1: Using ST2 Sterilization Cartridge** (reusable):

1. Watermaker OFF, hull valve closed
2. Prepare ST2 cartridge:
   - Open cartridge (save O-ring)
   - Remove top screen
   - Place foam at bottom
   - Pour sterilizing powder in
   - Replace top screen and close
3. Remove 5µm and 25µm cartridges from pre-filter
4. Install ST2 cartridge in place of 5µm cartridge
5. Turn 3-way valve to fresh water position
6. Run for 20 seconds
7. Sterilization lasts up to 6 months

**Before next use after sterilization**:
- Rinse system with fresh water for 10 minutes
- Remove ST2 cartridge
- Reinstall standard 5µm and 25µm cartridges

**Method 2: Manual Method** (without ST2 cartridge):
- Mix sterilizing solution (1 bag in 8 liters fresh water)
- Disconnect seawater inlet pipe
- Place in bucket with solution
- Start watermaker without increasing pressure
- Run until bucket empties
- Reconnect pipe

### High-Pressure Pump

- Half-filled with 15W40 or 20W40 multigrade oil
- Check oil level on gauge (do not overfill)
- Oil does not need changing over time
- Remove transport tape from red oil filler cap before use

### Winterization / Frost Protection

!!! warning "Freezing Risk"
    In case of frost risk, take these steps:

1. **Empty flowmeter**:
   - Disconnect blue output pipe at control panel
   - Blow or inject air into pipe
   - Alternate pressing solenoid valve button at panel back

2. **Protect membranes**:
   - Cover with blankets or insulation
   - Never expose to temperatures below 0°C

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Leak on pressure regulator | Control cable gland loosened | Tighten with 12mm wrench |
| HP pump is noisy | Reduced water inlet or air | Check pipe diameter, clamps, filter cleanliness |
| HP pump is noisy | Pressure not in green zone | Set pressure to green zone |
| Oil leak on HP pump | Worn gaskets on connecting rods | Replace gaskets |
| Insufficient water flow | Water too cold | Normal - 2.5-5% reduction per °C |
| Insufficient water flow | Pre-filter dirty | Replace pre-filter cartridges |
| Insufficient water flow | Power supply too weak | Recharge batteries, check connections |
| Insufficient water flow | Voltage drop in cable | Install cable with larger section |
| Water leaks under HP head | Worn gaskets | Replace piston gaskets |
| Pressure not rising | Dirty pump valves | Remove and clean valves in pump head |
| Red LED alarm at startup | Low pressure - air in system | Check seawater valve and pre-filter, restart |
| Red LED during operation | No power to pressure sensor | Check sensor or system voltage |
| Red LED during operation | Pressure too high | Switch off, fully open regulator, restart |

### LED Indicator Guide
