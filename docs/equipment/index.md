# Equipment

Manufacturer manuals and boat-specific notes. Organize by category so crew can quickly find references.

Suggested categories:

- Navigation (autopilot, chartplotter, instruments)
- Power (chargers, inverters, alternators, solar)
- Propulsion (engines, saildrives, controls)
- Water (watermaker, pumps, heaters)
- Safety (EPIRB, AIS, raft)
- Galley (refrigeration, cooktop, oven)

Place manuals under `equipment/<category>/<manufacturer>/manuals/` and create a short Markdown summary per device.
