                 NOTICE
If you have an installation with two orthree
engines and only one engine is operating,
the water pickup (thru-hull) of the
non-running engine(s) should be closed.
This will prevent water from being forced
past the seawater pump and eventually
finding its way into the engine. The result
of water entering the engine could cause
seizure or other serious problems.



If you have an installation with two orthree
engines, and only one engine is operating,
please note that if the propeller shaft
thru-hull (stuffing box) is lubricated by
engine water pressure and the engines are
interconnected, care must be taken that
water from the running engine does not
enter the exhaust of the non-running
engine(s). This water could cause seizure
of the non-running engine(s).
Consult authorized YANMAR Marine
dealer or distributor for a complete
explanation ofthis condition.



If you have an installation with two orthree
engines, and only one engine is operating,
it is important to limit the amount of throttle
applied to the running engine. If you
observe black smoke or movement of the
throttle does not increase engine speed,
you are overloading the engine that is
running. Immediately throttle back to
approximately 2/3 throttle or to a setting
where the engine performs normally.
Failure to do so may cause the running
engine to overheat or cause excess
carbon buildup which may shorten the
engine’s life.



Never turn off the battery switch (if
equipped) or short the battery cables
during operation. Damage to the electrical
system will result.

Do not operate the engine at low idle or at
low speed and light load for more than
30 minutes at a time. Since unburned fuel
and engine oil will adhere to the piston
rings when operating at low speeds for
long periods, this will interfere with proper
movement ofthe rings and the engine oil
consumption may increase. Low idle
speed does not allow break-in of sliding
parts.

FUNCTION OF MAJOR COMPONENTS

    Name of Component                                                        Function

Fuel Filter                      The fuel filter removes contaminants and sediments from the diesel fuel. Periodic replacement
                                 of the fuel filter is necessary. See PERIODIC MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE on page 113 for
                                 the replacement frequency.

Fuel pre-filter                  The water separator removes contaminants, sediment and water from diesel fuel going to the
(Water separator)                fuel filter. This is a required component of the fuel system and is standard equipment with
                                 every engine. The water separator is installed between the fuel tank and the fuel filter.
                                 Periodically drain the water from the water separator using the drain cock at the bottom ofthe
                                 separator and replace the filter element.

Fuel Priming Pump                This is a manual fuel pump. Pushing the knob on the top of the fuel pre-filter feeds the fuel.
                                 This pump is also used to bleed air from the fuel system.

Engine Oil Filler Port           Filler port for engine oil.

Engine Oil Filter                Filters fine metal fragments and carbon from the engine oil. Filtered engine oil is distributed to
                                 the engine’s moving parts. The filter is a cartridge type and the element should be replaced
                                 periodically. See Changing the Engine Oil and Replacing the Engine Oil Filter Element on
                                 page 127.

Marine Gear Filler Port          Filler port for marine gear lube oil. Located on top of the marine gear case.

Cooling System                   There are two cooling systems: closed cooling with coolant and seawater. The engine is
                                 cooled by the closed cooling circuit. The closed circuit is cooled by seawater using a heat
                                 exchanger. The seawater also cools the marine gear oil and intake air (depending on model)
                                 through the cooler(s) in an open circuit.

Coolant pump                     The centrifugal water pump circulates coolant inside the engine. The circulating pump is
                                 driven by a V-ribbed belt.

Seawater Pump                    Pumps seawater from outside vessel to the engine. The seawater pump is gear-driven and
                                 has a replaceable rubber impeller. Do not operate it without seawater, as this will damage the
                                 impeller.

Reservoir                        The pressure valve in the filler cap releases vapor and hot water overflow to the reservoir.
                                 When the engine stops and the coolant cools, the pressure in coolant tank drops. The filler
                                 cap vacuum valve then opens to send water back from the reservoir. This minimizes coolant
                                 consumption. The closed cooling system coolant level can easily be checked and refilled in
                                 this tank.

Oil Cooler - Engine              A heat exchanger that cools high temperature engine oil using coolant.

Oil Cooler - Marine Gear         This heat exchanger cools the marine gear (KMH4A) oil using seawater.
(Optional)

Turbocharger (if equipped)       The turbocharger pressurizes the air coming into the engine. It is driven by a turbine that is
                                 energized by exhaust gases.

Air cooler (if equipped)         This heat exchanger cools the pressurized charging air from the turbocharger with seawater
                                 to increase the charging air quantity.

Intake Silencer (Air Cleaner)    The intake silencer guards against dirt in the air and reduces the noise of air intake.

Nameplates                       Nameplates are provided on the engine and the marine gear and have the model, serial
                                 number and other data.

FEATURES

     Component/feature                                                    Description

Controller                    By controlling the fuel injection timing, volume, pressure and number in accordance with the
                              target speed indication entered from the accelerator sensor, the controller adjusts the engine
                              speed and power.

Fuel pump (supply pump)       The fuel pump supplies fuel to the common rail.

Common rail                   The common rail stores the compressed high-pressure fuel from the supply pump and
                              distributes fuel to the injector in each cylinder.

Fuel injector                 The Fuel Injectors the high-pressure fuel from the rail to the engine combustion room after
                              receiving a signal from the ECU in the most appropriate injection timing, injection volume,
                              injection ratio, number of injection and spray condition.

Accelerator sensor            Unlike mechanical governors, the common rail fuel injection system has no governor lever.
                              The accelerator sensor serves as the governor lever to provide the speed command signal
                              (voltage signal) to the ECU for engine speed control.

Engine diagnosis tool         Allows the operator to troubleshoot the cause of a problem based on detailed information
                              regarding the problem occurring in the ECU. This tool can also be used for data maintenance
                              tasks including programming and mapping. See TROUBLESHOOTING on page 135.

A single handle-type (Figure 22) should
be used to operate the marine gear clutch
(NEUTRAL, FORWARD and REVERSE)
and to control the engine speed.

The handle controls the direction of the
boat (ahead or astem) and also acts as an
accelerator by increasing engine speed as
the lever is pushed further in FORWARD
or REVERSE directions.

When the handle is pulled out
(Figure 23, (1)), the engine speed can be
controlled without engaging the clutch.
The clutch remains in NEUTRAL, no load
position. Turn the knob (Figure 23, (2))
counterclockwise to move the handle or
clockwise to lock the handle.

PRODUCT OVERVIEW

VESSEL CONTROL SYSTEM (VC10)
3/4JH common rail series engine is a fully electronic control engine, which is controlled by
YANMAR’s original “Vessel Control System (VC10)”.

The control equipment consists of the Switch Panel, the Display, the Drive & Helm ECU,
the Control Head and the Backup Panel, which are connected by the cable harness to the
engine and marine gear or Shift Actuator for remote control operation.

Note: The YANMAR Vessel Control System (VC10) was designed to operate the 3/4JH
         common rail series and drive system. There are many control functions and diagnostic
         functions that are integrated together to insure safe operation. If this system is not
         utilized in specific accordance with the instructions in this manual or the system is
         modified in any way, YANMAR will not be responsible for any warranty failures in the
         operation of the system or the vessel utilizing the system.
         YANMAR has designed the Vessel Control System (VC10) in conjunction with the
         3/4JH common rail series. The system has many functions that must be configured
         and calibrations must be made before the vessel can be operated. Please arrange
         to have a YANMAR trained technician inspect the vessel prior to the vessels
         operation.

PRODUCT OVERVIEW

VESSEL CONTROL SYSTEM (VC20)
3/4JH common rail series engine is a fully electronic control engine, which is controlled by
YANMAR’s original “Vessel Control System (VC20)”.

The control equipment consists of the Switch Panel, the Display, the Drive & Helm ECU,
the Control Head and the Backup Panel, which are connected by the cable harness to the
engine and marine gear or Shift Actuator for remote control operation.

Note: The YANMAR Vessel Control System (VC20) was designed to operate the 3/4JH
          common rail series and drive system. There are many               contro! functions and diagnostic
          functions that are integrated together to insure safe operation. If this system is not
          utilized in specific accordance with the instructions in this manual or the system is
          modified in any way, YANMAR will not be responsible for any warranty failures in the
          operation of the system or the vessel utilizing the system.
          YANMAR has designed the Vessel Control System (VC20) in conjunction with the
          3/4JH common rail series. The system has many functions that must be configured
          and calibrations must be made before the vessel can be operated. Please arrange
          to have a YANMAR trained technician inspect the vessel prior to the vessels
          operation.

Tightening Fasteners

Use the correct amount of torque when you tighten fasteners on the engine.
Applying excessive torque may damage the fastener or component and not enough
torque may cause a leak or component failure.


                    NOTICE
     a     The tightening torque in the Standard Torque Chart should be applied only to the
           bolts with a “8.8” head (JIS strength classification: 8.8). Apply 60% torque to
‘        “bolts that are not listed. Apply 80% torque when tightened to aluminum alloy.

EPA MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
To maintain optimum engine performance and compliance with the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) Regulations for Engines, it is essential that you follow the
PERIODIC MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE on page 113 and the PERIODIC
MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES on page 116.

EPA Requirements for USA and Other Applicable Countries
The EPA emission regulation is applicable only in the USA and other countries that have
adopted the EPA requirements in part or in whole. Determine and follow the emission
regulations in the country where your engine will be operating to assist you in specified
compliance.

Environmental Condition for operation and maintenance

The following environmental operating conditions and maintenance should be observed,
in order
       to keep engine performance.

* Ambient temperature: -20 °C to +40 °C (-4 °F to +104 °F)

* Relative humidity: 80% or lower

The diesel fuel should be:

* ASTM D975 No. 1-D $15, No. 2-D S15, or equivalent (minimum of cetane No. 45)

The lubricating oil should be:

* API Service Categories CD, CF, CF-4, Cl and Cl-4.

Be sure to perform inspections as outlined in PERIODIC MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES
on page 176 and keep a record of the results.

Pay particular attention to these important points:

* Replacing the engine oil

* Replacing the engine oil filter

* Replacing the fuel filter

* Cleaning the intake silencer (air cleanen

Note: Inspections are divided into two sections in accordance with who is responsible for
      performing the inspection: the user or the maker.

PERIODIC MAINTENANCE

Inspection and Maintenance

See Inspection and Maintenance of Emission-Related Parts on page 115 for the EPA
emission-related parts. Inspection and maintenance procedures not shown in /nspection
and Maintenance of Emission-Related Parts on page 115 are covered in PERIODIC
MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE on page 113.

This maintenance must be performed to keep the emission values of your engine in the
standard values during the warranty period. The warranty period is determined by the age
of the engine or the number of hours of operation.

Installation of Exhaust Sampling Port

All engines subject to emission standards shall be equipped with a connection in the
engine exhaust system that is located downstream of the engine, and before any point at
which the exhaust contacts water (or any other cooling / scrubbing medium), for the
temporary attachment of gaseous and/or particulate emissions sampling equipment.
This connection shall be internally threaded with standard pipe threads of a size not larger
than 12.7 mm (0.5 in.), and shall be closed by a pipe plug when not in use.
Equivalent connections are allowed.

The instructions for the proper installation and location of the required sample port, in
addition to those specified above in the quoted federal regulation, are follows:

1. The connection should be located as far downstream as reasonably practicable from
      any sharp bend (of 30 degrees or more) in the exhaust pipe to help ensure that a
     well-mixed exhaust flow sample may be taken;

2. The requirement that the connection be located before any point at which the exhaust
      contacts water (or any other cooling / scrubbing medium) does not include contact with
     water used to cool exhaust manifolds, unless the water is allowed to come into direct
      contact with the exhaust gases;

3. To allow ready access to the sample port, the connection should be located, if possible
     given the constraints of vessel design, approximately 0.6 to 1.8 m (2 to 6 ft) above a
     deck or walkway;

4. To facilitate insertion and withdrawal of an exhaust sample probe, there should be no
      obstructions for at least one and one-half exhaust pipe / stack diameters perpendicular,
      i.e., 90 degrees, from the sample port; and
5.    If a threaded connection is used, both the internal and external threads should be
      coated with a high-temperature, anti-seize compound before the initial installation and
      at every subsequent re-installation to facilitate removal of the connection for testing.

PERIODIC MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE
Daily and periodic maintenance is important to keep the engine in good operating
condition. The following is a summary of maintenance items by periodic maintenance
intervals. Periodic maintenance intervals vary depending on engine application, loads,
diesel fuel and engine oil used and are hard to establish definitively. The following should
be treated only as a general guideline.


                   NOTICE
Establish a periodic maintenance plan according to the engine application and make sure
to perform the required periodic maintenance at the intervals indicated. Failure to follow
these guidelines will impair the engine’s safety and performance characteristics, shorten
the engine’s life and may affect the warranty coverage on your engine.

Before performing any troubleshooting           AFTER STARTING
procedures within this section, review the
                                                Just after the engine has started, check the
Safety section on page 3.
                                                following items at a low engine speed:
If a problem occurs, stop the engine
                                                Is sufficient water being discharged
immediately. Refer

                                                from the seawater outlet pipe?
in the Troubleshooting Chart to identify the
problem.                                        If the discharge is low, stop the engine
                                                immediately. Identify the cause and repair.

                                                Is the smoke color normal?

                                                The continuous emission of black exhaust
                                                smoke indicates engine overloading.
                                                This shortens the engines life and should
                                                be avoided.

                                                Are there abnormal vibrations or noise?
