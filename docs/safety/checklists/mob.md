1. Shout "Man Overboard" and press MOB on all available instruments.
2. Toss flotation (life ring, dan buoy) toward the victim.
3. Assign a spotter to maintain visual contact.
4. Engage recovery maneuver (e.g., quick stop, figure-eight).
5. Prepare retrieval gear and first-aid.

Fill in exact MOB procedure once crew training preferences are defined.
