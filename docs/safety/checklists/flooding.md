# Flooding Response Checklist

1. Identify source (hull breach, thru-hull, hose) and slow ingress.
2. Engage bilge pumps and monitor discharge.
3. Isolate electrical circuits at risk of immersion.
4. Prepare collision mats or soft plugs.
5. Log time, position, and depth of water gained.

Add bilge pump capacities, thru-hull locations, and damage control gear specifics.
