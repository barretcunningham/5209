# Fire Response Checklist

1. Raise the alarm and shut down affected systems (fuel, electrics).
2. Don PPE (gloves, goggles) and deploy appropriate extinguisher.
3. Close hatches/vents if safe to smother fire.
4. Report status to skipper and prepare abandon-ship judgement.
5. Ventilate and monitor for reflash once extinguished.

Document specific extinguisher locations and shutoffs for the boat.
