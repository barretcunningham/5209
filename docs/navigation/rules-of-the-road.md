# Rules of the Road

The 'International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea' are the traffic laws of the sea. They give clear indication about passing, approaching, giving way and overtaking to avoid collisions with other boats. They apply equally to all boats afloat. All boat operators must thoroughly understand and apply the rules.

Actions must be clear and deliberate so others can see your intentions. Never assume the operator of another boat will observe the rules; always be prepared to take appropriate action to avoid a collision.

!!! danger "Critical Rule"
    Boat operators must do whatever is necessary to avoid a collision.

## Collision Rules

The collision rules establish the responsibilities between vessels to prevent accidents at sea. These rules create a predictable pattern of behavior that allows mariners to anticipate the actions of other vessels.

Key principles:
- Actions must be clear and deliberate
- Take action early to avoid close-quarters situations
- Never assume others will follow the rules
- Always be prepared to take evasive action

## Lookout

A good lookout must be kept at all times, especially in:
- Bad weather
- Restricted visibility
- When using autopilot

All available means—sight, hearing, and radar (if equipped)—should be used to assess the situation and risk of collision.

## Safe Speed

Travel at a safe speed at which you can maneuver to avoid collisions. The appropriate speed varies depending on:

- Visibility conditions
- Traffic density
- Proximity to hazards
- Water depth
- Maneuverability of your vessel
- Background lighting (day vs. night)

!!! warning "Speed Restrictions"
    Exceeding 3 knots when you are within 70m of the shore, another boat, any reef, any navigation aid, and when approaching any anchorage will void your insurance cover.

!!! tip "Rough Conditions"
    If sea conditions are rough, the best thing to do is slow down.

## Assessing Risk of Collision and Taking Action

Use all means available to assess whether another boat poses a risk of collision. An early indicator is to see whether the **bearing** of a boat approaching you remains steady. If it does, a risk of collision exists.

When a risk exists:
- Take early positive action (changing course and/or speed)
- Make changes large enough to be obvious to the other vessel
- Continuously monitor the situation until well clear

## Channels

When navigating in narrow channels:

- All boats should travel on the **starboard side** (right side) of the channel
- Pass oncoming boats on the port side (left side)
- Avoid anchoring in channels, especially near markers
- Small boats (including sailing boats) should keep clear of large boats that have limited room to maneuver

!!! note "Passing in Wide Channels"
    If plenty of distance separates two passing boats, there's no need to deliberately alter course to pass to the right of the other boat. The rule is simply to remove doubt in the event of a close situation.

## Giving Way

### Summary

The hierarchy of right-of-way:

1. **Give way to any boats approaching on your starboard side** (right side)
2. An overtaking boat must give way
3. Power gives way to sail
4. Give way to boats that are restricted in their ability to maneuver
5. Give way to boats that are constrained by their draft

!!! danger "Critical Rule"
    Give way to any boat on your starboard side (right hand side of your boat).

### Head On

When meeting head on, both boats are required to alter course to **starboard (right)**. Any turn should be large enough to be obvious to the other boat.

### Sailing Boats

#### Wind on Different Sides
When each sailing boat has the wind on a different side, **the boat with wind on the port side (left) shall keep out of the way** of the other.

If sailing and you cannot determine with certainty whether the other boat has the wind on the port or starboard side, or if the other boat is aware of you, take action to keep clear.

#### Wind on the Same Side
When both sailing boats have the wind on the same side, **the boat to windward shall keep out of the way** of the boat to leeward.

### Power and Sail

A power boat generally gives way to sail unless the sailing boat is in the process of overtaking it. However, don't expect large, less maneuverable boats under power to give way.

!!! info "Small Craft Caution"
    All small craft should give large boats a wide berth.

!!! warning "Never Assume"
    Never assume the other skipper knows the rules. Avoid other vessels at all costs.
